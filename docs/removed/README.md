# Legacy Marketplace Page Extraction

This directory captures the legacy implementation of `frontend/pages/index.jsx` that still includes
all of the inline editor scaffolding, UI state, and navigation handlers. Keeping it here makes it
easy to reference or resurrect that experience without combing through git history.

- `index-legacy.jsx` â€” snapshot of the editor-enabled marketplace page for archival reference.

Use these snapshots if you need to revive any of the legacy functionality without digging through
the git history.
